Hi, I'm Ferchus, an enthusiastic game development student, driven by a deep passion for crafting immersive gaming experiences. My current focus revolves around designing and implementing AI tools that elevate gameplay and bring virtual worlds to life. I am constantly on the lookout for inventive approaches to integrating artificial intelligence into game mechanics. With a solid foundation in game design and programming, my goal is to push the boundaries of interactive entertainment and contribute to the advancement of the gaming industry while embracing continuous learning and growth.


I created this site using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with the [Blowfish](https://blowfish.page/) theme. If you want to see its source code you can check the GitHub repo:
