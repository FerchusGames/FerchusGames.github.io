## Designate a YouTube account



You don't want to mix the YouTube account that you use for regular entertainment with the one you'll use for sentence mining; it just makes it harder to fully commit to one or the other. So, as a first step, I recommend that you assign or create a YouTube account with no previous activity for the sole purpose of consuming content on your target language. In general, after following these steps I also recommend taking the opportunity to clear YouTube as a source of distraction in your computer and using it for entertainment in the living room TV or somewhere else to make a strong mental connection between using the site on a pc and studying a language.

## Always use fullscreen



You can enter and exit fullscreen by pressing F11 in any browser. If you tend to wander around in your browser or other apps when you should be concentrating on the current video, this is a must. Very simple tip, but extremely effective.
