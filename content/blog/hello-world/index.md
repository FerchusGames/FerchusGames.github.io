Hi, I'm Ferchus, an enthusiastic game development student, driven by a deep passion for crafting immersive gaming experiences. With a solid foundation in game design and programming, my goal is to push the boundaries of interactive entertainment and contribute to the advancement of the gaming industry while embracing continuous learning and growth.

I created this site using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with the [Blowfish](https://blowfish.page/) theme. If you want to see its source code you can check the GitHub repo:
