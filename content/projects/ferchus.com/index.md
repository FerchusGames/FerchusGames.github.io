This website came to life because I wanted my own domain. My real name is Fernando, but ever since I can remember people have been calling me Ferchus, which I actually prefer. I was curious if the domain ferchus.com was available, so I quickly searched for it, and surprise, surprise, it was available! The domain price was surprisingly cheap, but I knew hosting prices were quite high since essentially you're renting a server 24/7.

Thinking about what I could do with my domain, I remembered that my professor from the third semester, Ivan Herrera, had the website [horothenic.com](https://horothenic.com), his personal blog. He had mentioned that he didn't pay for hosting because his site was static. There were certain limitations, but for sites like blogs, it was sufficient.

I researched the easiest frameworks to create a blog-style website and found the theme I currently use, [Blowfish](https://blowfish.page/), which utilizes the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) framework for displaying pages and building the site. Initially, the website was different from what you see now; it was solely a blog site with only the first four articles available in the blog section.

After finishing my sixth semester in mid-2024, I decided to expand the website beyond just a blog and use it as my personal portfolio. I compiled a list of projects I had completed both in school and independently, creating a blog-style article for each one. While the articles are in blog format, it made sense for me to use this approach. Although the site isn't highly specialized, it allows me to share my work easily. For instance, for game projects, I can include links and buttons directing visitors to the games on itch.io.

This project can be considered an indefinite endeavor because, rather than a final product, it serves as a platform for me to showcase my skills and creations and progress my career. I hope you find my portfolio enjoyable and that you explore all the different areas I've worked on, from Unity programming to brand creation and creative writing.
