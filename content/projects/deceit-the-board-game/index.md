 Board game adaptation of the video game Deceit. It was realized for the Game Design Workshop class. It took a few adjustments, but our peers had a blast playing it! We made a fun and tense social experience and we are very proud of it!

Since it was made during the pandemic, we made both a physical and virtual version, so that we could test it out with multiple people. 

Made in collaboration with my classmate and friend Gabriel Alejandro Villagómez Hernández.
