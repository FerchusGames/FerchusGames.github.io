 Video edit of my expedition through Radiohead's KID A MNESIA EXHIBITION. I took a few hours of my recording, selected my favorite moments, grabbed promotional material for Kid A and Amnesiac, and synced them up to the song Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors.

They are my favorite band, so when they announced that they were releasing an Unreal Engine digital experience, I was thrilled! 

I made this for my Video Game History class, in which we made four video essays. You can watch three of those on my channel, they are called "2001_09_13" and "Por qu√© DEBES JUGAR LISA: The Painful", but they are in spanish.

The assignment for each one was to make a video game-related video essay, and my teacher always appreciated and enjoyed my videos for trying to be creative with them. He was always invested in them and, because I delivered them early, asked me to share them with my peers to set an example.
