 Interactive prototype for Niumi, an app designed to gamify the process of overcoming other app addictions, from social media to video games. It was developed following Google's Design Sprint Methodology

Performing every phase of the sprint lead to a very clean and functional design. The market research allowed us to make the app effective on solving the core problem.

Made in collaboration with my classmate and friend Gabriel Alejandro Villagómez Hernández.
