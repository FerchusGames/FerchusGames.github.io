This video showcases my work during the level design class, featuring four mini projects: Neon White, Portal 2, Fallout 3, and Baba Is You.

## Neon White
Neon White is a fast-paced first-person shooter and puzzle-platformer where players assume the role of White, an assassin from Hell competing with other demon slayers for a chance to live permanently in Heaven.

We began by analyzing the game, starting with a superficial understanding of its genre and overall concept. Then, we delved into a detailed level-by-level analysis, examining the beats of each level, identifying the rhythm and events at every second. I also compared the game's mechanics with those I aimed to implement in my level.

Our task was to create a prototype of the game using Unreal Engine, focusing on a tutorial level where players would learn to run, jump, shoot, take shortcuts, and discard cards.

## Portal 2
Portal 2 is a first-person puzzle-platform game developed by Valve. Players use a portal gun to create portals on flat surfaces to solve puzzles and navigate through the game's levels.

For this project, the objective was to design a tutorial level, an intermediate level, and an advanced level. I used the game's built-in level editor, which is quite intuitive. The tutorial and intermediate levels were relatively straightforward to create, but the advanced level was a complex challenge, taking over 10 hours to complete.

I learned a lot about playtesting during this project, continually adjusting the levels based on player feedback. For instance, I had to increase the lighting in areas where players struggled to see portal surfaces. Sometimes, players would complete levels in unintended ways, and I had to decide whether to fix these or leave them as creative solutions. Most of the time, I opted to fix them.

## Fallout 3
Fallout 3 is an open-world action role-playing game set in a post-apocalyptic Washington, D.C. Players navigate the Wasteland, completing quests, interacting with characters, and battling enemies.

For the Fallout 3 project, we used the G.E.C.K. (Garden of Eden Creation Kit). This exercise focused on learning the tool, which was used for creating Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas, and Fallout 4. Despite its somewhat outdated interface, it was fascinating to see how everything worked, from implementing objects to organizing menus. It felt like learning to use Unity again, but without having to write code from scratch.

Although we didn't have enough time to create a lengthy quest, we learned to use the systems effectively. It was quite cool to see our mini-quests integrated into the game, like adding a door in the middle of the player’s house (literally) that led to my custom level.

## Baba Is You
Baba Is You is a unique puzzle game where players manipulate the rules of the game by pushing blocks with words to create or modify rules. The goal is to reach the flag or achieve the objective defined by the manipulated rules.

In this project, similar to Portal 2, we created a tutorial, intermediate, and advanced level using the game's level editor. Since it’s a 2D game with confined screens, designing the levels was straightforward.

I tested these levels with three people who were unfamiliar with the game. This allowed me to create a well-structured progression from tutorial to advanced levels, ensuring players learned the game's concepts effectively. It was interesting to see them solve puzzles and feel smart about their solutions. Sometimes, they would find unintended ways to complete the levels, which I had to fix.

## The End of the Line
This experience was incredibly interesting and fun. Although I'm not certain if I will become a professional level designer, I found it immensely gratifying to see people play my levels. The best part was seeing the smiles on their faces when they enjoyed my creations.

If there's one takeaway from this project, it's the importance of playtesting. It not only helps to improve the final product but also provides the joy of seeing others enjoy what you've developed. The greatest pleasure of being a game developer is watching people enjoy your games. So, moving forward, I will definitely incorporate more playtesting into my future projects.
